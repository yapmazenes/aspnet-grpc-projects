- Basically implemented e-commerce logic with only gRPC communication. Have 3 gRPC server applications which are Product â€” ShoppingCart and Discount gRPC services. 
- 2 worker services which are Product and ShoppingCart Worker Service.
- Worker services will be client and perform operations over the gRPC server applications.
- System secured the gRPC services with standalone Identity Server microservices with OAuth 2.0 and JWT token.
